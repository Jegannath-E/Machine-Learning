Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection and prediction crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool in healthcare like predicting heart disease. One such model that can be used is logistic regression that is used to model the probability of a binary outcome such as the presence or absence of heart diseaseâ€”based on input features. In this project we will explore how Logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients and the accuracy of the module.
The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of approximately 84% on the testing dataset. Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective algorithm due to its simplicity and strong performance. The project demonstrated how a systematic approach to data preprocessing and model selection that could significantly enhance the probability and outcome of heart disease with accuracy.
